We aimed to implement the Heninger-shacham algorithm [Reconstructing RSA Private Keys from Random Key Bits](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03356-8_1), it is partially based on the premise that an attacker can exploit a phyicaly property of memories of type DRAM by conducting a Cold boot attack
